NOTE: This part is heavily influenced by https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents[Julia Evans Brag Document]

== Goals for this year

- Improve my *Rust* shenanigans, to learn and hopefully avoid getting kicked so often by the Borrow Checker
- Propagate my love for *HTMX*, because the Web should be as simple as an AJAX request
- Be a speaker in a public conference, on a stage, on a topic I love to talk about
- Keep publishing episodes in the podcast I'm a part of (https://www.podcastics.com/podcast/wespeakcloud/[WeSpeakCloud])

== Goals for next year

- Push a bit further on *Bevy* and through it polish my ECS game development skills

== Projects

I mostly worked on closed sourced code, unfortunately, so I'm not at liberty to discuss it publicly.

Just know that it involves DevOps culture fostering, CI/CD development for fast developper feedback, and I also perform audits on node.js/Typescript environments.

== Collaboration & mentorship

- I'm the «git» guy almost everywhere I go. Three-way merge conflicts, reflog, and fixups are my bread and butter !
- Recently I tried to shift my mentoring audience to tech people that aren't junior anymore but also lacks a bit to truly embrace become Senior/Lead in their roles, especially on the public side, since it's an important topic for me, and that I truly care about fostering a enviroment based on quality and transparency.
- I lead a mentorship initiative in my company to help people lacking some hard or soft skills find an appropriate mentor that will help them improve.

== Company building

- In addition to my mentoring initiatives, I contribute to my company podcast https://www.podcastics.com/podcast/wespeakcloud/[WeSpeakCloud]

== Outside of work

- I play Riichi Mahjong at https://mahjongsoul.game.yo-star.com/. Feel free to enjoy pain with me there ! 🀄
- As any average Cinema enjoyer, I have a https://letterboxd.com/stephane_trebel/[Letterboxd]
- My favorite song to play on my guitar is *Hotel California* and the guitar solo I hope to master one day is the one from *Highway Star* by Deep Purple 🥰
- I am a huuuuuuge _Souls_ videogames fan, so If you have ever been kicked in the teeth by Malenia, or if you succeeded in head banging Kalameet and Midir an NG+2, know that you're not alone !
